Lab 0: EOF Analysis of Global SST Patterns
EAS 4860/6860
Due: Friday Jan 31, 2025

Abstract
This lab develops understanding of Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis through application to global climate data. Students will: (1) preprocess multidimensional climate data for EOF analysis, (2) compute and visualize leading modes of variability, and (3) interpret results in the context of known climate phenomena. Students should use SST or Tropical SST from datasets of their choosing, though additional variables could be included as warranted.

Introduction
EOF analysis, also known as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), is a powerful technique for identifying dominant patterns in climate data. The method decomposes spatiotemporal data into orthogonal modes of variability:

X(t,s) = Σ[PCk(t)EOFk(s)]
Methods
Data Preprocessing
Remove seasonal cycle
Apply latitude weighting: W(s) = √cos(φ)
Handle missing values
Format data matrix
EOF Computation
Compute covariance matrix
Solve eigenvalue problem
Calculate explained variance

OISST
Required Analysis
